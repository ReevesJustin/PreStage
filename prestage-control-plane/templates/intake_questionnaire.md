# Intake Questionnaire

This document captures initial intent only.
It is NOT authoritative and does NOT permit readiness gating
until its contents are applied to canonical docs.

---

## Intake Classification

Intake Type: [New Project | New Workstream]

Project Name: [Required]

Workstream Name: [Required if New Workstream]

---

## Canonical Application Targets (Required)

The following canonical updates will be required during the Apply step:

- CONTEXT.md section to create/update: [Section header]
- STATUS.md section to create/update: [Section header]
- DECISIONS.md entry required: [Yes/No]

Flow B acknowledgment:
- Workstreams are recorded as sections inside canonical docs.
- No new directories or repositories will be created.

---

## Task Mode

Task Mode: [Coding | Research | Writing]

---

## Objective Definition

Objective:
[Clear, explicit objective statement]

Out-of-Scope:
[Explicit exclusions and non-goals]

Acceptance Criteria:
[Concrete, measurable success conditions]

---

## Constraints and Boundaries

Constraints:
[Hard limits: time, scope, posture, exclusions]

Allowed Context Surface:
[Permitted files and directories only]

Tooling Posture:
Filesystem-only. No web access. No MCP. No execution.

---

## Universal Validation Questions

- Why does this project or workstream exist?
- What does success concretely look like?
- What must explicitly NOT happen?

---

## Mode-Specific Details

### Coding
- Codebase location (path only):
- Languages / frameworks:
- Files or subsystems in scope:

### Research
- Local knowledge sources (filesystem only):
- Question boundaries:
- Required output form:

### Writing
- Topic focus:
- Intended audience:
- Structural or style constraints:

## Intake Acknowledgment

- This intake does not authorize execution.
- This intake does not authorize readiness gating.
- Readiness may only be evaluated after canonical docs are updated.
